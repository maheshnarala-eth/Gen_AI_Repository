✅ FORCE – Physics Chapter Notes



 1. Meaning of Force

 Force is a push or pull acting on an object.

📌 Example:

* Pushing a door
* Pulling a cart
* Kicking a football



 2. Effects of Force

Force can:

1. Start motion
   → A stationary object begins to move

2. Stop motion
   → A moving object comes to rest

3. Change speed
   → Increase or decrease velocity

4. Change direction
   → Turning a moving ball

5. Change shape/size
   → Stretching rubber band



 3. Force is a Vector Quantity

✔ Force has:

* Magnitude (how much)
* Direction (which way)



 4. Unit of Force

 SI Unit: Newton (N)

1 Newton = force needed to accelerate 1 kg mass by 1 m/s²



 5. Balanced and Unbalanced Forces



 ✅ Balanced Forces

* Equal in magnitude
* Opposite in direction
* Net force = 0
* No change in motion

Example: Tug of war (equal pull)



 ✅ Unbalanced Forces

* Net force ≠ 0
* Object accelerates or changes motion

Example: A football being kicked



 6. Types of Forces

Forces are mainly of two types:



 A. Contact Forces

Force acts only when objects touch.

 1. Muscular Force

* Produced by muscles
  Example: lifting a bag

 2. Frictional Force

* Opposes motion
  Example: brakes stopping a bicycle



 B. Non-Contact Forces

Force acts without touching.

 1. Gravitational Force

* Attraction between masses
  Example: falling of apple

 2. Magnetic Force

* Attraction/repulsion between magnets
  Example: compass needle movement

 3. Electrostatic Force

* Force between charges
  Example: rubbed balloon attracting paper



 7. Friction (Important Topic)

 Friction is a force that opposes relative motion.

✅ Useful:

* Walking possible
* Vehicles move

❌ Harmful:

* Causes wear and tear
* Produces heat



 8. Newton’s Laws of Motion (Class 9 Level)

 1st Law – Law of Inertia

An object remains at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by an external force.



 2nd Law

Force = Mass × Acceleration

[
F = ma
]



 3rd Law

Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.

Example: Rocket launch



 9. Pressure and Force Relation

[
Pressure = \frac{Force}{Area}
]

* More force → more pressure
* Less area → more pressure

Example: sharp knife cuts easily



 ✅ One-Line Revision Points

* Force = push or pull
* SI Unit = Newton
* Balanced force → no motion change
* Unbalanced force → acceleration
* Contact forces: muscular, friction
* Non-contact forces: gravity, magnetic, electrostatic
